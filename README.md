# VeinMiner 1.20.2
A customisable Minecraft SpigotMC/Paper/Purpur VeinMiner plugin that I developed.
# Storage Location
The plugin stores data in the remote location of `plugins/kablammoman/veinminer/` to guarantee that no conflicts between data of other plugins.
# Commands
- Customise what blocks are treated as "vein-minerable" with `/toggleveintype <block_types>`
- Customise the maximum distance between the source block and others that will break if they're the same type with `/setbreakrange <range>`
- Reset the configuration to the defaults with `/resetveinminer`
- Toggle on or off the functionality of the plugin (still allows for plugin commands) with `/toggleveinminer`
All of the above commands require operator status on the server to use.
