# VeinMiner 1.20.2
A customisable Minecraft SpigotMC/Paper/Purpur Vein Miner plugin that I developed.
# Features
- Customise what blocks are treated as "vein-minerable" with `/toggleveintype`
- Customise the maximum distance between the source block and others that will break if they're the same type with `/setbreakrange`
- Reset the configuration to the defaults with `/resetveinminer`
- Toggle on or off the functionality of the plugin (still allows for plugin commands) with `/toggleveinminer`
All of the above commands require operator status on the server to use.
